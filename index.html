<p><b>MAY 3, 1469 - Birth</b> - Niccolo Machiavelli was born in 1469. He was born into an influential family, and quickly got involved in Florencian politics. He became a clerk in 1494. </p>
<p><b>JAN 1, 1475 - Early Life</b> - Machiavelli received a good education at a young age. He was a student under Paolo da Ronciglione, and likely went to the University of Florence. He received a good humanist training, which likely influenced his works in later life.</p>
<p><b>JAN 1, 1477 - Onin War Ends</b> - In 1477, the eleven year long Onin War in Japan ended. It had been caused by arguments over who would succeed Shogun Ashikaga Yoshimasa, as the shogun had first named his brother heir to the throne, but then named his son heir after his son's birth. The end of the Onin War marked the beginning of Sengoku Jidai, a century long period in which local disciplined armies known as Ikki formed, and family feuds caused chaos in Japan.</p>
<p><b>JAN 1, 1478 - Conspiracy Against the Medici Family</b> - In 1478, the Pazzi, a rival banking family of the Medici, conspire to assassinate Lorenzo Medici and his brother, Giuliano, as they prey in church. Conspiring with the Pazzi are the archbishop of Pisa and Pope Sixtus IV's nephew. When the Pazzi take action, they kill Giuliano, but let Lorenzo escape with only a wound. All the conspirators are dead by nightfall, which leads to the excommunication of Lorenzo, and problems between the pope and the Medici.</p>
<p><b>AUG 3, 1492 - Discovery of the Americas</b> - Christopher Columbus received funding for a westward voyage from King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella of Spain. The goal of this voyage was to see if there was an efficient trade route between Europe and Asia by travelling west, across the Atlantic Ocean. Columbus set off on his voyage from a Spanish port in 1492. His fleet consisted of three ships: the Nina, Pinta, and Santa Maria, and they discovered the Americas in 1493.</p>
<p><b>JAN 1, 1494 - Exile of the Medici</b> - King Charles VIII of France marches on Florence, and Piero Medici, in fear of being conquered, meets with Charles to make peace. Piero ends up giving the ports of Pisa and Livorno to the French, and the signoria protest. When he goes to meet them, the Medici Palace gets mobbed, and the Medici Family is exiled from Florence.</p>
<p><b>JUN 7, 1494 - Treaty of Tordesillas</b> - In 1494, the Spanish Pope Alexander VI drew a meridian 100 leagues west of the Cape Verde Islands. He decreed that all newly dicovered lands west of the line were to belong to Spain, and all lands east of the line went to Portugal. Portugese King John II met with the two Spanish monarchs, and made a compromise that the line be moved further west, giving Spain more room to maneuver in Asia, as the line went all the way around the world. This became known as the Treaty of Tordesillas.</p>
